# US Population

## Introduction
In this project, I use R Shiny App and create a user interface visualization tool to analyze US Census Population data interactively by user selection of state and year.
Also, I created R Markdown Presentataion to briefly show the UI application workflow.

## Data - US Census Bureau, Population Division

The U.S.Census Bureau Population is based on a series of short-term projections for the resident population of the United States. This includes people whose usual residence is in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. These projections do not include members of the Armed Forces overseas, their dependents, or other U.S. citizens residing outside the United States.

The projections are based on a monthly series of population estimates starting with the April 1, 2010 resident population from the 2010 Census.

At the end of each year, a new series of population estimates, from the census date forward, is used to revise the postcensal estimates, including the population clock projections series. Once a series of monthly projections is completed, the daily population clock numbers are derived by interpolation. Within each calendar month, the daily numerical population change is assumed to be constant, subject to negligible differences caused by rounding.
